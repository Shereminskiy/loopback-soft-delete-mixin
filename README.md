SoftDelete
=============

This module is designed for the [Strongloop Loopback](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback) framework. It allows entities of any Model to be "soft deleted" by adding `deletedAt` and `_isDeleted` attributes. Queries following the standard format will no return these entities; they can only be accessed by adding `{ deleted: true }` to the query object (at the same level as `where`, `include` etc).

It is heavily inspired by [loopback-ds-timestamp-mixin](https://github.com/clarkbw/loopback-ds-timestamp-mixin).

Install
-------

```bash
  npm install --save loopback-softdelete-mixin
```

Configure
----------

To use with your Models add the `mixins` attribute to the definition object of your model config.

```json
  {
    "name": "Widget",
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "string",
      },
    },
    "mixins": {
      "SoftDelete" : true,
    },
  },
```

There are a number of configurable options to the mixin. You can specify alternative property names for `deletedAt` and `_isDeleted`, as well as configuring deletion to "scrub" the entity. If true, this sets all but the "id" fields to null. If an array, it will only scrub properties with those names.

```json
  "mixins": {
    "SoftDelete": {
      "deletedAt": "deletedOn",
      "_isDeleted": "isDeleted",
      "scrub": true,
    },
  },
```

Retrieving deleted entities
---------------------------

To run queries that include deleted items in the response, add `{ deleted: true }` to the query object (at the same level as `where`, `include` etc).
